# Agent & MCP Integration Test Plan

## Objective
Verify all 9 agents can successfully use all 6 MCPs without errors.

## Test Strategy

### Phase 1: Direct MCP Tests (Verify MCPs Work)
- [ ] **Ref MCP**: Search documentation for React hooks
- [ ] **Exa MCP**: Get code context for Node.js Express
- [ ] **Playwright MCP**: Navigate to a simple site and take screenshot
- [ ] **Semgrep MCP**: Scan backend code for security issues
- [ ] **Context7 MCP**: Resolve and fetch library documentation

### Phase 2: Agent-Specific Tests
- [ ] **Backend Engineer**: Review code using semgrep + get docs from context7
- [ ] **Senior Frontend**: Test UI with playwright + search exa code context
- [ ] **DevOps**: Search Ref docs for Render deployment + context7 for DevOps patterns
- [ ] **Security Analyst**: Run semgrep scan + search security best practices
- [ ] **Design Review**: Use playwright to navigate and test UI responsiveness
- [ ] **QA Testing**: Use playwright for test automation + semgrep for test analysis
- [ ] **Product Manager**: Use exa to research market + context7 for features
- [ ] **System Architecture**: Use Ref docs + context7 for architecture patterns
- [ ] **UI/UX**: Use playwright for responsive design testing + exa for design trends

### Phase 3: Verification
- [ ] All agents completed assigned tests
- [ ] No errors in MCP calls
- [ ] All MCPs returned expected results
- [ ] Agents can call multiple MCPs in sequence
