Use the Senior Frontend Engineer agent for React code reviews, performance optimization, and architecture decisions.

The Senior Frontend Engineer agent provides:
- Code quality and architecture analysis
- Component composition and reusability review
- React performance optimization (rendering, memoization, code splitting)
- Performance profiling and bottleneck identification
- Testing strategy and test coverage recommendations
- Accessibility (WCAG) audit
- TypeScript and type safety improvements
- Bundle size and build optimization

**Examples of good questions:**
- "Review the DashboardPage component for performance issues and testing gaps"
- "Audit our React application for performance bottlenecks"
- "Design a testing strategy for 0% to 60% test coverage"
- "How can we improve component architecture for reusability?"
- "Conduct a code quality review of the AdminSettingsPage"

Simply ask your frontend question and the Senior Frontend Engineer agent will provide detailed code analysis with specific optimization recommendations and architectural improvements.
