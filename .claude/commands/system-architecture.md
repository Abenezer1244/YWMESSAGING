description: System design, scalability analysis, architecture patterns, and technology selection
---

Use the System Architecture agent for major design decisions, scaling concerns, and technology evaluation.

The System Architecture agent provides:
- Scalability analysis and bottleneck identification
- High-availability and resilience patterns
- Caching strategy (Redis, CDN, in-memory)
- Database scaling (read replicas, sharding, partitioning)
- Message queue architecture (Bull, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS)
- Microservices vs. monolith evaluation
- Technology selection and evaluation
- 3-phase scaling roadmap with cost projections
- Load balancing and horizontal scaling strategies

**Examples of good questions:**
- "We're expecting 10x growth. How should we redesign our architecture?"
- "Design a scalability plan for 1,000 to 10,000 churches"
- "What are the current bottlenecks and how do we fix them?"
- "Should we implement message queues? What technology?"
- "Create a 12-month infrastructure roadmap with cost projections"

Simply ask your architecture question and the System Architecture agent will provide detailed scaling analysis with technology recommendations and phased implementation roadmap.
