Use the System Architecture agent for major design decisions, scaling concerns, and technology evaluation.

Specify your architectural challenge, and the agent will:
1. Understand requirements and constraints
2. Evaluate architecture patterns
3. Design for scalability and reliability
4. Recommend technology stack
5. Create implementation plan

Example usage:
```
/system-architecture
