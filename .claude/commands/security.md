Use the Security Analyst agent for security reviews, vulnerability assessment, and compliance checks.

The Security Analyst agent provides:
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability analysis
- Threat modeling and attack surface analysis
- Code security audit
- Configuration security review
- Compliance assessment (GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA, etc.)
- Vulnerability prioritization and remediation roadmap
- Security hardening recommendations
- Incident response planning

**Examples of good questions:**
- "Conduct a security audit of our authentication system for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities"
- "Identify and prioritize security vulnerabilities in our codebase"
- "What security changes do we need for GDPR and SOC 2 compliance?"
- "Design a threat model for our SMS platform"
- "Create a 6-month security hardening roadmap"

Simply ask your security question and the Security Analyst agent will provide detailed vulnerability analysis with prioritized remediation strategies and compliance guidance.
