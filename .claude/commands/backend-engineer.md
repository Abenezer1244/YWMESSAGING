Use the Backend Engineer agent to review backend code, optimize performance, and design scalable APIs.

The Backend Engineer agent provides:
- Architecture review and assessment
- N+1 query detection and optimization
- Database index recommendations
- API design review and improvements
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Caching strategy recommendations
- Scaling and throughput analysis
- Business logic validation

**Examples of good questions:**
- "Review the SMS sending service for N+1 queries, missing indexes, and performance bottlenecks"
- "How can we handle 10x growth? What are the database bottlenecks?"
- "Design an API endpoint for delivery tier management"
- "Optimize the church member import process for 10,000+ members"
- "How should we implement message queues for SMS delivery?"

Simply ask your question and the Backend Engineer agent will provide detailed technical analysis with specific code recommendations and implementation strategies.
