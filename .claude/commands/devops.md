Use the DevOps agent for infrastructure decisions, deployment planning, and scaling strategies.

The DevOps agent provides:
- CI/CD pipeline design and GitHub Actions automation
- Staging environment architecture
- Deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, rolling)
- Infrastructure scaling analysis
- Monitoring and alerting configuration
- Disaster recovery and backup planning
- Cost optimization recommendations
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) templates

**Examples of good questions:**
- "Design a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for our Node.js + React application"
- "Create a staging environment that mirrors production"
- "How should we deploy with zero downtime?"
- "Design monitoring and alerting with Datadog"
- "Create a disaster recovery plan with 4-hour RTO and 1-hour RPO"

Simply ask your infrastructure question and the DevOps agent will provide detailed strategies with implementation examples and cost analysis.
