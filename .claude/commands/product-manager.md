Use the Product Manager agent for strategic product decisions and roadmap planning.

The Product Manager agent provides:
- Market analysis and competitive landscape research
- User story creation (As a..., I want..., So that...)
- Feature prioritization using RICE scoring (Reach × Impact × Confidence / Effort)
- Phased implementation roadmap
- Revenue and growth projections
- Business case analysis

Use the Task tool to invoke the product-manager agent with your specific question:

**Examples of good questions:**
- "Which 2 features should we build in Q1 2026 to maximize revenue growth?"
- "We have 1,000 churches and want to reach 10,000. What features drive retention and conversion?"
- "Should we focus on email integration, analytics dashboard, or mobile app first?"
- "How can we improve our trial-to-paid conversion from 25% to 35%?"
- "What's the best pricing strategy for scaling from $82K to $820K MRR?"

The agent will analyze your question and deliver a comprehensive strategic recommendation with detailed rationale, RICE scoring, implementation timeline, and expected business impact.
