Use the Product Manager agent to analyze requirements, define features, and prioritize product work.

Specify your product challenge, and the agent will:
1. Understand the business problem
2. Research market context
3. Create user stories and acceptance criteria
4. Prioritize using RICE scoring
5. Build implementation roadmap

Example usage:
```
/product-manager

We need to decide whether to add SMS delivery analytics. What should we prioritize and how should we phase this?
```
