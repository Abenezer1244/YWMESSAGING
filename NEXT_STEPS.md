# Next Steps - Roadmap & Action Items

**Current Status:** Security hardening complete, code committed & pushed
**Next Phase:** Staging deployment & implementation of remaining features
**Date:** 2024-10-30

---

## Overview

All security infrastructure is in place and documented. The next priority is deploying to a staging environment and implementing the HTTPOnly cookie migration.

---

## Critical Path (Must Do First)

### 1. üöÄ **Deploy to Staging Environment** (1-2 days)

**Status:** Ready - Guide complete
**Guide:** `STAGING_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

**Steps:**
1. Create Render account (or use alternative hosting)
2. Set up PostgreSQL database (staging)
3. Deploy backend service
4. Deploy frontend service
5. Run database migrations
6. Execute full testing checklist

**Expected Outcome:**
- Backend running at: `https://ywmessaging-staging-api.onrender.com`
- Frontend running at: `https://ywmessaging-staging-web.onrender.com`
- Database connected and migrated
- All security headers active
- Rate limiting working

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Login works
- ‚úÖ Dashboard loads
- ‚úÖ Messages can be sent
- ‚úÖ Payment flow works (test mode)
- ‚úÖ Security headers present
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting active

---

### 2. üîê **Implement HTTPOnly Cookies** (3-4 days)

**Status:** Documented - Implementation pending
**Guide:** `HTTPONLY_COOKIES_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

**Backend Changes Needed:**

A. **Update `backend/src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts`:**
```typescript
// Add these functions
export const setAuthCookies = (res, accessToken, refreshToken) => {
  // Set HTTPOnly cookies with secure flags
};

export const clearAuthCookies = (res) => {
  // Clear cookies on logout
};

export const extractTokenFromCookies = (req, res, next) => {
  // Extract token from cookies for verification
};
```

B. **Update `backend/src/routes/auth.routes.ts`:**
```typescript
// Login route: Use setAuthCookies() instead of returning tokens
// Refresh route: Implement token refresh via cookie
// Logout route: Use clearAuthCookies()
```

C. **Update `backend/src/middleware/jwt.middleware.ts`:**
```typescript
// Verify token from cookies instead of Authorization header
export const verifyToken = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.cookies.accessToken;
  // ... verify logic
};
```

**Frontend Changes Needed:**

A. **Update `frontend/src/api/client.ts`:**
```typescript
// Add credentials: 'include' to all requests
// Remove Authorization header logic
const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL,
  withCredentials: true  // ‚Üê Include cookies
});
```

B. **Update `frontend/src/stores/authStore.ts`:**
```typescript
// Stop storing tokens in localStorage
// Only keep user data in state
// Remove token expiry tracking (server handles now)
```

C. **Update Login Component:**
```typescript
// Remove localStorage.setItem calls for tokens
// Only call login API with credentials: 'include'
```

**Testing Needed:**
- ‚úÖ Login creates HTTPOnly cookies
- ‚úÖ Cookies sent automatically with requests
- ‚úÖ Token refresh works
- ‚úÖ Logout clears cookies
- ‚úÖ No tokens in localStorage
- ‚úÖ No tokens in console

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days (development + testing)

---

## High Priority (Do Next)

### 3. üìã **Full UAT Testing** (3-5 days)

**Guide:** `STRIPE_TESTING_GUIDE.md` + Testing checklist in `STAGING_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

**Testing Areas:**

A. **Authentication (2-3 hours)**
- [ ] Register new account
- [ ] Login with valid credentials
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials (rate limit test)
- [ ] Password reset (rate limited to 3/hour)
- [ ] Logout clears session
- [ ] Page reload maintains session

B. **Payment Processing (2-3 hours)**
- [ ] Stripe Elements displays correctly
- [ ] Test card (4242 4242 4242 4242) succeeds
- [ ] Declined card (4000 0000 0000 0002) fails
- [ ] Invalid card number rejected
- [ ] Missing cardholder name rejected
- [ ] Terms agreement required
- [ ] No card data in console/network

C. **Security Headers (1 hour)**
- [ ] CSP header present
- [ ] HSTS header present
- [ ] X-Frame-Options: DENY
- [ ] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [ ] Referrer-Policy present
- [ ] CORS working correctly

D. **Rate Limiting (1-2 hours)**
- [ ] Auth endpoints: 5 per 15 min
- [ ] Billing endpoints: 5 per 15 min
- [ ] General API: 100 per 15 min
- [ ] 429 responses returned when exceeded
- [ ] Rate limit headers present

**Documentation:** Create test report with pass/fail for each item

---

## Medium Priority (Do Later - 2-3 Weeks)

### 4. üõ°Ô∏è **Replace Archived csurf Package** (2-3 days)

**Why:** `csurf` is archived and has transitive vulnerabilities

**Options:**
1. **Use Express helmet csrf** (if available in newer version)
2. **Implement custom CSRF tokens**
3. **Use OWASP CSRF Guard library**

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

**Timeline:** Next sprint

---

### 5. üîç **CSP Nonce Implementation** (2-3 days)

**Why:** Remove 'unsafe-inline' from CSP for stronger XSS protection

**Changes Needed:**
- Generate nonce in backend for each request
- Add nonce to helmet CSP config
- Apply nonce to inline scripts in frontend
- Test that inline scripts still execute

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks out

---

### 6. üìä **Add Security Monitoring** (2-3 days)

**Options:**
- Sentry for error tracking
- DataDog for monitoring
- LogRocket for session replay
- Uptime Robot for monitoring

**What to Monitor:**
- Rate limit violations
- Authentication failures
- Payment errors
- CSP violations
- API response times

---

## Low Priority (Do Later - Next Quarter)

### 7. üîê **Zero-Trust Security Model**
- OAuth2 for external services
- Request signing for APIs
- Enhanced audit logging

### 8. üß™ **Penetration Testing**
- Professional security audit
- Fix identified vulnerabilities
- Document security posture

### 9. ‚úÖ **Compliance Certifications**
- SOC 2 Type II
- GDPR compliance
- PCI-DSS full compliance

---

## Blockers/Risks

### Potential Issues:

1. **Database Migrations**
   - Risk: Schema mismatch between environments
   - Mitigation: Test migrations locally first, backup production

2. **Cookie Domain Issues**
   - Risk: Cookies not being set in staging
   - Mitigation: Verify domain configuration in app.ts

3. **CORS with Credentials**
   - Risk: CORS errors when credentials: 'include' is set
   - Mitigation: Ensure Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header present

4. **Breaking Changes in Dependencies**
   - Risk: Updated packages cause runtime errors
   - Mitigation: Test thoroughly in staging first

---

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Before starting each phase:

1. **Staging Deployment:**
   - Do I have all required credentials?
   - Are environment variables properly configured?
   - Is the database ready?

2. **HTTPOnly Implementation:**
   - Have I read the implementation guide completely?
   - Do I understand the cookie configuration?
   - Have I prepared test cases?

3. **UAT Testing:**
   - Do I have test data ready?
   - Are all test scenarios documented?
   - Do I have success/failure criteria?
